# Urban Snooze

    The purpose of this app is to deploy a desktop and mobile version of an app for a concept business, Urban Snooze - a brick and mortar facility with nap pods that would allow for patrons to take naps in designated areas. The business would allow users to select locations, dates, and times for their appointments as well see the location of the business facilities through Google Maps.
